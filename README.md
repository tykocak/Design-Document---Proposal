<h1> Style Guide </h1>

<h2> Font Selection </h2>
Considering the adventurous and energetic nature of Caffeinated Climbing, I would recommend a sans-serif font with a clean, modern aesthetic. Montserrat would be a good option. I would also recommend lobster as a secondary font. Lobster is a handwritten font that adds a touch of personality and warmth. 

<h2> Color Palette </h2>
To evoke a sense of adventure and nature, a color palette centered around greens and blues would be appropriate. For accents, orange or yellow could be used to represent energy and warmth.

<h2> Mood and Tone </h2>
The style guide for Caffeinated Climbing Guide Service should convey a sense of adventure, excitement, and community. The design should be inviting, accessible, and visually appealing. The tone should be enthusiastic, informative, and friendly.
